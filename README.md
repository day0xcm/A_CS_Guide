# A_CS_Guide
Share my experience from zero to one in CS.

The item satrts from 04/22/2021 to now.

The first book I given is Computer Science Illuminated.This book is used to build a knowledge structure from bottom to top in CS.And Code:The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software,for rookies,is a not bad book to understand number repressentation system. 

The Next book I given is C Primer Plus.Now more and more rookies perfers Java or Python to C/C++ as their first coding language,I disagree it.Without C/C++,you may be lack in mastering in pointer,memory and other bottom level knowledge.By the way,without excese enough,you don't realize your real strength.Thus,Data Structure and Algorithms Analysis is a good book to improve yourself,or you still continue to do those simple,even stupid,math issues.Above all,from now/04/22/2021,I will add code to DS_and_AA_in_C to motivate you.
