# A_CS_Guide
## TARGET
share my experience from zero to one in CS
## MESSAGE
*The project satrts from 04/22/2021 to now
*The project includes passages, codings and items
*The project will update for a long time
## NOTES
*The first book I given is Computer Science Illuminated. This book is used to build a knowledge structure from bottom to top in CS. And, Code:The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, for rookies, is a not bad book to understand number repressentation system. 
*The Next book I given is C Primer Plus. Now more and more rookies perfer Java or Python to C/C++ as their first language, I disagree it deadly. Without C/C++, you may be lost in pointer, memory and other bottom knowledge. By the way, without excese enough, you also don't realize your real strength. Thus, Data Structure and Algorithms Analysis in C is a good guy to improve yourself.No time for those simple, even stupid, math coding issues. Above all, from now/04/22/2021, I will add codings to DS_and_AA_in_C to motivate you do too.
