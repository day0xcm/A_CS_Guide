# A_CS_Guide
## TARGET
share my experience from zero to one in CS
## MESSAGE
* The project satrts from 04/22/2021 to now
* The project includes passages, codings and items
* The project will update for a long time
* The project will puase from 01/05/2021 to 06/05/2021
## NOTES
* The first book I given is Computer Science Illuminated. This book is used to build a knowledge structure from bottom to top in CS. And, Code:The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, for rookies, is a not bad book to understand number repressentation system. 
* The Next book I given is C Primer Plus. Now more and more rookies perfer Java or Python to C/C++ as their first language, I disagree it deadly. Without C/C++, you may be lost in pointer, memory and other bottom knowledge.
* By the way, without exercise enough, you also don't realize your real strength. Thus, Data Structure and Algorithms Analysis in C is a good guy to improve yourself.No time for those simple, even stupid, math coding issues. Above all, from now/04/22/2021, I will add codings to DS_and_AA_in_C, including two parts: DS(chapter 1 - 6) and Algorithms(chapter 7 - more), to motivate you do it too.
